This script will update the master brnach with any newly-created markdown files corresponding to new blog posts. 
which are the raw material out of which the full Pelican site is generated. 

NOTE:
Various other scripts will do the hard work of creating new content for the blog
(both creating new markdown files, and turning those markdown files into HTML content.)
