Asteroid of the Day: Ren Man Mar

Named in honor of David J. Eicher, founder and editor-in-chief of Deep Sky magazine. He enjoyed an almost unprecedented career as a radio and later as a television moderator, becoming one of the most popular stars of German entertainment. As governor intendent of Cuyo, he created the Andes army, crossed those mountains, and by conquering the Spanish army at the battles of Chacabuco and Maipu (1817-1818) assured Chile's independence. She has found evidence for extensive, olivine-rich bedrock on Mars.
