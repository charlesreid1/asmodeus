Asteroid of the Day: Brenbonso

Paul Briede (b. 1985) was awarded fourth place in the 2003 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair for his engineering project. As a graduate student, he took a large fraction of the plates for the Palomar-National Geographic Sky Survey, and his analysis of them produced the Abell catalogue of rich clusters of galaxies. Swedenborg began publication of Sweden's first scientific journal in 1715. Today the lake is famous as an area of great natural beauty.
