Asteroid of the Day: Spreria

Named by the discoverer in honor of his home valley, the Swiss canton and town of Glarus. He has written numerous articles on these subjects, including some on Canadian meteorites, in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, and he has been of much practical help to the astrometric program carried out at the University of Victoria. He died at a relatively young age on 1996 Sept. It was first mentioned as a village with the church of St. Michael Archangel in 1263, and as a town from the year 1365, but the site was first settled in ancient times.
