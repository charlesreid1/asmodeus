Asteroid of the Day: Bres

Gale D. Gant (b. 1936) helped organize the Palomar Observatory's 1.2-m Schmidt Oschin Telescope plate archive. He got his first lessons at the organ from his father Paul Bruhns, a pupil of Franz Tunder. Its prosperity was and is still based on the cloth industry. He contributed extensively to botany and zoology.
