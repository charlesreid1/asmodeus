PAO: The Hornet now estimates they are 4 and three-quarters miles away from the spacecraft.

PAO: 4 minutes away from separation, 4 minutes.

Armstrong: Okay.

Collins: [Garble] there's no way for me [garble] probe and drogue [garble] docking [garble]. TVC Servo Power 1 and 2 are Off?

Aldrin: No, I got to keep the chart. (Under static) Standby for the pitchover.

Collins: You got some things up there.

Collins: Yes. Thank you, Ron.

Armstrong: About out? But it appears to be a very cohesive material of the same sort. Right.

Aldrin: Here you are. Apollo 11. Pitch 1, Off...

Collins: [Garble] let me move in just a [garble]. Thank you much.

Evans: Good morning.

Evans: Roger. And, break. Thank you.

Evans: Columbia and Tranquility, I'll give you a Mark at 20 minutes to go, and that's in about 20 seconds.

Collins: Chamber pressure is 100 psi even. I haven't been at this very long. I see a horizon. We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.

Duke: That's affirmative, Mike. Thank you much. Over.

Armstrong: Think we ought to get the long lens on, Mike? Well, give me an example.

Aldrin: Congratulations.

Duke: Say again. Stand by for my Mark.

Duke: Roger. Over. We noticed the Cryo pressure dropped a moment ago. Roger.

Collins: Rog.

Duke: Roger, Neil. Appreciate it. GET 194:46:03; 267, plus 11.02, minus 172.03, 06.8. Over.

Armstrong: About ready for a little help? We're just waiting for the cabin pressure to bleed so...To blow enough pressure to open the hatch. (Pause)

Aldrin: All at once. I have that. Over.

Collins: 11. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. 4.4. I just wanted to confirm that. That's the biggest one you ever seen in your life. [Garble.]

McCandless: Roger.

Armstrong: ...departed it with a little Delta-V.

Aldrin: That's got it. ) Locked. Houston, looks like there's very little difference between the two (tanks).

Collins: Pitch and Yaw, Auto.

Aldrin: It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving. [Garble] green.

Duke: Stand by. Ready for your readback. [Pause.]

Duke: We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve. We see the card up now. Over.

Duke: Roger. Over.

Duke: We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Excuse me. Your friendly White Team has your coming home information, if you're ready to copy. Over.

Armstrong: (Push-to-Talk) Roger. Charging Batt A, then on to...

Duke: Roger. I'll get the straight story for you.

Collins: Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.

Aldrin: Okay, I want to get the lights out then.

McCandless: 11, this is Houston. [Pause.]

McCandless: Roger. Over.

Collins: Charlie, on the PTC, we're just waiting our 20 minutes here for all thruster activity to damp out. ] Yeah, hello there sports fans. Can you hear our Master Alarm in the background? [No answer.]

Armstrong: Yes.

McCandless: Roger.

Collins: Okay. Horizon 11-degree line at T<sub>IG</sub> minus 2 minutes. Say again, please.

Armstrong: You can have it if you want it. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.

Collins: You sure you have the right power switch on? Columbia's on the high gain.

Armstrong: [Garble] chart. What do you need?

Aldrin: Radar circuit breaker. Over.

Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]

Collins: ... I guess...leave them on Inertial for the time being.

McCandless: For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees.

Armstrong: Thank you.

Collins: Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter.

Aldrin: Roger. Okay.

Collins: We're going to have to check that out. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average;  and (I) understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west;  actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?

Aldrin: Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2. Yes.

Collins: Will that one do? As long as you're on Bit-rate Low.

Armstrong: Okay, we're operate - 59:59.

Collins: I'll bet you we're never going to catch up.

Collins: Maybe we can change the weight, but that's TLI plus 90; we got plenty of time.

Collins: Roger.

Evans: Eagle, Houston. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30 000. We copy. And you might pass to Columbia, we don't have him yet.

Collins: [Garble] this COAS as far as steering and everything goes, it's hopeless. (Cough)

Duke: Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Over.

Collins: Roger.

Duke: Stand by, Mike.

Aldrin: Yes, just a second. Vega and Deneb; 007, 144, 068. (Pause)

Collins: How would you like the camera? Up, down, zero. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.

Collins: Okay, we're - we're in DAP control. Thank you.

Aldrin: ...some particles jumping around on your screen. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. It would have been 0.8 foot per second. And a maneuver of - and a maneuver of 51.3.

Duke: Stand by, Buzz.

Aldrin: All of a sudden there, we heard a little click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off.

Duke: Roger. We'd like you to terminate average G. Over.

Aldrin: How'd the - is this the first part of the attitude comparison check or the second part? Oh, that thing is hard.

Collins: Okay. I picked up a little roll. I'd appreciate that. Maybe - remember when the SCS was acting up?

Duke: Roger, 11. We want to get to the proper sleep attitude before we proceed on with the comm check. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. Roger.

Collins: I'm right in the middle of my orange juice. I have roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, and yaw 357.5. Thank you kindly. Well, I promise to let you know if I stop breathing.

Collins: Okay.

Collins: Well, I know there's an orange dot on this ... somewhere. I've got 470 now for R-dot, and I just broke lock. I'm still holding [garble].

Collins: Okay, we got to visually acquire Moon, take pictures, and then you got a P52 to do.

Duke: Roger. Standing by for your readback. [Long pause.]

Collins: Thank you.

Duke: Roger. [Long pause.]

Armstrong: Okay.

Collins: Yes, I got to go to horizontal at 35. What'd he say?

Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Does it look to you like the [garble] the right way?

Collins: You have to take it easy. [Pause.]

Aldrin: Yes, I [garble].

Duke: Five-by, 11. [Pause.]

Armstrong: Shutdown!

Aldrin: Okay.

Collins: Yes, why - I don't care. Stand by for [garble].

McCandless: Apollo 11, Houston. They really came through in the ninth.

McCandless: Negative.

Collins: I mean the - I mean the whole - I mean the gas consumption would be a lot more than I would have guessed, you know?

McCandless: Roger. Over.

Armstrong: I updated the LOS time in your...

Armstrong: Go ahead.

Collins: Rog. Okay.

McCandless: Roger. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. (For) the RCS configuration, we're requesting you use quads Alpha and Bravo. Mayor Louie Welch promises a lifting of lawn watering restrictions if the rains continue. Out.

Armstrong: Okay.

Collins: That's affirmative.

McCandless: Roger. [Long pause.]

Collins: Okay, now.

Armstrong: Okay, Charlie.

Collins: (Not having heard Evans yet) How goes it?

Armstrong: Yes, I'll look.

Collins: Our chamber pressure onboard was higher that time, too.

Armstrong: You're right.

Aldrin: Roger.

Garriott: Roger, Mike. I suggest you move back away. Two more verifications, here. Over.

Armstrong: That's okay. Go ahead.

Collins: Amazing how quickly you adapt. And time to stop also, please.

Aldrin: What did you have on [garble]? It's still hooked in it. 60...

Armstrong: Oh, I got them.

McCandless: 11, this is Houston. ]

Collins: By 54 point... As a matter of curiosity, our O<sub>2</sub> flow meter is pegged full-scale High.

Armstrong: Oh, must have been around - 210. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Ignition time? Greens do not show up very well. Alright.

Collins: It's...Menkent.

McCandless: Cliff is not on right now. If you want to go that way, crank it up, and then you can drive it around and look where you want.

Collins: You ready to do it? And I'm locked on and I got about a half signal strength, and they can't hear me.

Aldrin: Okay.

Armstrong: Excuse me.

Collins: Okay. [No answer.]

Duke: Apollo 11, Houston. It's really superb. The rates are damped out well enough for you to initiate the PTC now. Our biggest drift on the gyro's is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-Gyro. [Pause.] Out. Would he please go to High Gain. [Long pause.]

Collins: Clockwise.

Armstrong: Go ahead. Buzz?

Duke: 11, Houston. We see that. It's a typo error. How do you read - normal voice? Out.

Collins: Roger.

Aldrin: [Garble] take that.

Aldrin: Alrighty.

Collins: Well, then we're not at the substellar point, if we're not. Okay.

Armstrong: We might make it in time.

McCandless: 11, Houston. Break. He's been over the hill, here, for a minute or so. Do you read? Over.

Armstrong: Roger.

Collins: Well, only one camera, but I've got [garble] lenses. We understood that, Charlie.

Armstrong: Okay.

Armstrong: 0.01. ...not really.

Armstrong: This one here?

Collins: Oh, yes, alright. Tell everybody take your sweet time. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. I've been in Delta the whole time but it doesn't seem to be [garble].

Collins: Okay, 96:01. Roger on the time;  and you want to cycle the fan...

McCandless: [Laughter] Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Delta Azimuth correction is plus 0.22, that is plus .22, and we do recommend the P52 alignment. If you're ready, we have a   update that we can pass up to you at this time, if you will give us P00 and Accept. Amen to that.

McCandless: Roger. Out.

Armstrong: Okay.

Armstrong: 15 - we're 7 minutes away.

Collins: Negative that. I've got that in work. Ready to copy.

Armstrong: [Garble]?

Aldrin: Roger.

Duke: Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We've lost our command interface with Goldstone. What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?

Collins: Fine.

McCandless: Oh, we were wondering what was new with you up there. Over.

Armstrong: Yes. (Pause)  Got it. 25...

Collins: Thrusting... We're going to leave it this way for TEI, right? Over.

Duke: Roger.

Duke: 11, that was a good picture there. We got a lot of noise in the background. (Pause)

Duke: 11, Houston. Mike, see you in the background. So we're real satisfied with the way the gyros are looking. Houston. You've got a Go.

Aldrin: Range/range rate is [garble].

Armstrong: Yes.

McCandless: Go ahead, 11. Over.

Armstrong: Okay, Mike, we passed the star check. We're up to 6...

Armstrong: Get the [garble], Buzz.

Duke: Roger. Over. Over.

Armstrong: Roger, Houston.

Collins: The razor wasn't in there?

Armstrong: Okay. Okay.

Duke: Eagle, Houston. We'll be happy to have you back.

Collins: I guess what I'm doing, I should do with the paper towels.

Armstrong: Oh, yes, I got it.

Collins: That's correct.

Armstrong: [Garble].

Collins: 35, 30 minutes. Ho, ho, ho!

Evans: Roger. Request P00 and Accept, and we'll give you a good ole LM vector. Over.

Aldrin: Okay, 6...okay, about 5 seconds to nominal. Allow probe to damp spacecraft oscillations?

McCandless: 11, this is Houston.

Collins: Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.

McCandless: Roger. Level sense arm at 8 plus 17; outboard cut-off at 9 plus 11. We will then command Omni Delta down here after you advise us you've switched, and then you can select Bravo on board and we'll be back in the Omni antenna commanding business. [Long pause.]

Collins: Go ahead.

Duke: Eagle, Houston. [Long pause.]

Duke: Thank you, sir. [Pause.]

Aldrin: You got it all vented now?

Collins: Yes.

Aldrin: [Garble]. There's no problem. Okay.

Aldrin: Roger. You want to try...?

Evans: Roger. Your Uncle Bob Moon accompanied him on the visit which included the LRL. Request Guidance Control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Columbia, Houston...

Evans: Columbia, Houston. Say again.

Aldrin: Got Delta-V? Dump.

Armstrong: We've got a - pitchdown and then a yaw to do...

Duke: That's one of those... It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Could you open the f-stop a little bit more? Roger.

Duke: Roger. We have the LM ascent Pad. [Long pause.]

Duke: Negative. Roger.

Armstrong: [Garble.]

Aldrin: Roger.

McCandless: [Laughter] Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Reading you loud and clear. [Pause.]

Armstrong: Houston, 11. Go ahead.

Collins: Okay.

Collins: Hey, we're closing in a leisurely fashion. How's our thruster firing activity? Beautiful.

Armstrong: Roger. Give me a time to load.

Aldrin: Negative.

McCandless: Say again, please.

Aldrin: Rog. Tomorrow, take - we're going to have to carry a lot of film to take as many pictures as they want.

Duke: Roger, Neil. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.

Collins: Somehow we'll figure a way to [garble].

Duke: What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now? It's a real steady picture, here. [Long pause.]

Aldrin: What was you doing?

Duke: Hello, Columbia.

Collins: Okay, let me get my - let me get my gouge out here.

Armstrong: Going to CSI Pad. Yes.

Collins: Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. Doesn't seem to me, for the PAD we got, we...we want to load in any...

Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11.

McCandless: Roger. We recommend an Auto maneuver to the attitudes in the - pen-and-inked into the Flight Plan. At time approximately 22:30 in the Flight Plan, in your post-sleep checklist, and in all other post-sleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says Auto RCS Jet Select, 16, to On, and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.

Collins: [Garble]. Thank you.

Armstrong: Okay.

Duke: Rog, Tranquility. [Long pause.]

Aldrin: Roger.

Aldrin: When we get the Sun behind us, we might be able to. They're welcome.

Collins: You ought to check the Flight Plan, it doesn't mention the (laughter) probe or the drogue.

Aldrin: Roger, I have it. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and [pause] - Now, no, wait a minute. On descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. Before I do that I would like to designate the   up to plus-X.

Evans: Roger, Columbia. (Pause)  Tranquility, affirmative. We see you getting ready for Sep. Everything looks mighty fine down here.

Armstrong: Buzz can hold it, and you're going to run the monitor.

Collins: I'll bet you a cup of coffee on it.

McCandless: Columbia, this is Houston.

Collins: Start after the rains in Houston. Yes.

Collins: [Very weak.]

Armstrong: Roger.

McCandless: Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Buzz, this is Houston through Tranquility. (To Mike) Stand by please.

Aldrin: Copy. It's 151, there's [garble], okay? Mark.

Armstrong: Go ahead.

Collins: Well, you know, - well, just looking at that one sample, it was - I'm surprised you didn't have a lot more dust. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. We think you're close, but no cigar.

Armstrong: Do you have any idea where the S-IVB is with respect to us?

Aldrin: Houston, Eagle.

Aldrin: Houston, Eagle.

Collins: [Very weak.] We've - you got to us just a little late. And 3.8.

Armstrong: [Garble] just before that last call. And we have all the fans Off.

McCandless: Roger.

Armstrong: They're all up.

Collins: Yes, pressure - you might get a little drop in it, I don't really know, but it came back up.

Aldrin: We ought to be able to get it...

McCandless: Sounds like one of these rotating restaurants. Roger...

Honeysuckle: Honeysuckle. Read you loud and clear.

Comm: Houston CapCom, Goldstone M&O Net 1. Read you the same.

Comm: Roger. Thank you.

Comm: Roger. Thank you.

Network: Okay. Stand by a minute, Goldstone.

Comm: Okay.

Armstrong: Okay. I got plenty of cable?

Duke: Rog, Neil. We'd like you to pull the circuit breaker on panel 11 for the mission timer. Over.

Armstrong: Roger. How does the roll attitude look?

Aldrin: Roger.

Armstrong: (Laughs)  A particularly good thought.

Aldrin: [Garble]. Oh, crap.

Armstrong: [Faint] This is 11, Houston. PAD angles: Delta-V<sub>GX</sub> after trim was 0.1, V<sub>GY</sub> 0.9, V<sub>GZ</sub> 0.1. Yes.
